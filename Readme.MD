# How to run
Kami2 is my favorite game. I decided to write a small script to find out solution when i got stuck.
I only test on my iphone 5c.
```
python solver.py [image_path] [number_of_moves]
```
Eg: python solver.py sample.jpg 4

# TODO
+ Using bruteforce all possible cases so it will be slow when number of moves is big
+ Need improvement to work all image size (other phones resolution). It only works with iphone 5 solution now.
